_Data sources, actions and blockers_

The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) leads digital transformation in government, collaborating with teams from other departments to help them build better public services. Alongside those departmental teams, GDS is transforming government together.

GDS has a large and complex digital analytics implementation (currently using Google Analytics and Piwik). GOV.UK and other GDS websites and digital services generate over 500 million hits a year and there are around 1000 users, accessing data over a large number of properties and views. And as most of the digital performance analysts focus their work on the data needs of their agile team, it can be hard to find the time to do all the vital work to support and manage the platform behind this.
