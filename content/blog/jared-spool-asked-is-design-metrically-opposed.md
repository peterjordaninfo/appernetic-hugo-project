The team at the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) had a visit from Jared Spool yesterday, where he posed the question is Design Metrically Opposed.

_Jared Spool speaking at Government Digital Service_

I enjoyed a very thought-provoking talk and fascinating post-talk chat. Though as an analyst, I felt there were a few too many <del>cheap</del> amusing anti Google Analytics jibes. Don't we spend our working lives getting colleagues to think about context, to identify *valuable* things to measure and develop hypotheses?

But Jared shared some great models to help us analysts add more value to design and recommended better ways of bringing different sources of data together.

### On data and ratios

Data  = **observations**
Assumptions = **inferences**

Observations > Inferences > Design decisions
See > Why we think it happened > Design decisions

Don't confuse **measure** & **metric**

Measure is what we count
Metric is what we track

Analytic is just a measure that software tracks. Don't use analytics just because they're easy to track. Beware agenda analytics, such as bounce rate.

User research can shine a light on inferences to test with analytics data.

Conversion rates are just ratios, they don't give you a handle on what you are designing for.

### On surveys
Don't track 'satisfaction' - the dining equivalent is 'edible'.

Explore richer measures like CE11, Gallup's 11 question metric of customer engagement.

### Customer journey mapping
Map out what the customer wants to do and identify stages. For each stage, track delight/frustration; so you can focus on fixing each stage.

When you've identified an issue in user research, use quant data from analytics to see if it is happening in the real world. Often, of course, this requires custom metrics.

Keep the numbers simple, so you can focus on behaviours.
