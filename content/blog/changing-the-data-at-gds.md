![Changing the ‘Data at GDS’ blog](https://res.cloudinary.com/df1mif8sk/image/upload/v1483137742/hugo/datablog-change_zjkbfc.jpg)

We've decided to reboot the ['Data at GDS blog'](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/ "Data at GDS blog") to focus only on posts relating to technical aspects of data work being done in GDS. So only posts from performance analysts, data analysts and data scientists will appear.

We hope this will provide a means of sharing our learning amongst ourselves and with colleagues both inside and outside government.

We’ll be sharing tips and hacks on data tools, development of data science prototypes and feedback from analytics events we’ve been involved in.
