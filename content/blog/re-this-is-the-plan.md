I've been re-reading [Craig Sullivan](https://twitter.com/OptimiseOrDie)'s recent blog post, [This is The Plan](https://medium.com/%40optimiseordie/this-is-the-plan-6b5c4c2f0041#.tsyxo5vft):

_This is the plan_

It's a great plan and an excellent template. It got me thinking how this fits into the culture of the wider agile team, where iteration can often look like this:


Not surprisingly a _Lean_ approach provides a way in; and I came across Joshua Kerievsky's post [Agile Vs. Lean Startup][6]. Kerievsky has a table where he compares the language or artifacts used in each and I found the _Lean Startup_ language much more meaningful from an analyst/insight perspective.

_Agile and Lean Start Up terms compared_

Of course, _Agile_ and _Lean Startup_ are largely compatible. The former more in a software development context and the latter more appropriate in business development/product management/customer development - where most analysts and user researchers are probably focussed.
